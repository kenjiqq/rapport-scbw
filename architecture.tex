\subsection{Decomposition of problem}
Michael Buro in his 2003 call for research \cite{buro2003rts} identified six
important sub-problems in real-time strategy games that he said would be
interesting for AI research to focus on:
\begin{description}
  \item [Resource management.] To be able to build up an army one needs to gather
    resources, and the balance between gathering resources (by creating workers),
    building an army and evolving through the technology tree is an important
    part of the macro/high-level strategy.
  \item [Decision making with uncertainty.] Because of fog of war, there is a
    high degree of uncertainty involved in the decision making. Therefore the AI
    
  \item Spatial and temporal reasoning
  \item Collaboration
  \item Opponent modelling
