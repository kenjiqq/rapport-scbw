\chapter{Evaluation}
\section{Evaluation of results}
Since we haven't actually implemented this architecture we can't evaluate any
actual results, and we have to rely on the results from the work we have based
our own architecture on.

\section{Summary}
We have created an architecture for a computer program that can play the game
StarCraft: Brood War.


\section{Discussion}


\section{Contributions}
We wrote most stuff ourselves, but we used blah and blergh.


\section{Impact}
We believe that this will forever change the human condition.


\section{Future work}
The biggest part remaining is to actually implement this architecture, and see
if it is viable. This will include more closely detailing the various
specialized processors in each layer, as well as elaborating on the meta-goals
for the core layer, and implementing a rule set to describe these.
