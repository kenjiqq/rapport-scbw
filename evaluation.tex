\chapter{Evaluation}
\section{Summary}
We have designed an architecture for a computer program that can play the game
StarCraft: Brood War, based on a cognitive architecture, emulating som of the
cognitive processes in the human mind.


\section{Discussion}


\section{Contributions}
For the structured literature review we collaborated with Magnus Sellereite
Fjell, Stian Veum M{\o}llersen, Tobias Laupsa Nilsen, J{\o}rgen B{\o}e Svendsen,
Espen Auran Rathe, Aleksander Lun{\o}e Waage, {\O}ystein Samuelsen, Finn Robin
K{\aa}veland Hansen, Dag-{\O}yvind Tornes and Jan Eriksson.


\section{Impact}
We believe that using cognitive models is interesting both from a
game-development perspective, for more realistic and engaging gameplay, as well
as from a purely academic viewpoint, furthering the understanding of cognitive
models.

\section{Future work}
The biggest part remaining is to actually implement this architecture, and see
if it is viable. This will include more closely detailing the various
specialized processors in each layer, as well as elaborating on the meta-goals
for the core layer, and implementing a rule set to describe these.

Another important extension would be to more tightly integrate learning into
the architecture.
