\section{Artificial Intelligences for StarCraft}
There have been a handful of relatively successful AIs for StarCraft.

\subsection{In-game AI}
The in-game AI is considered not very good.

\subsection{Berkeley Overmind}
This is considered one of the best AIs, not perhaps because it is very complex,
but because it has a solid ``cheese'' and has been well-tweaked.
