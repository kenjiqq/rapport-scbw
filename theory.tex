\chapter{Theory}
In this chapter we will the present theory that is important for our project.
Section \ref{sec:starcrafttheory} presents StarCraft the game, as well as
describes the main mechanics of a StarCraft match and the difference between the
races. Section \ref{sec:stateofai} describes current state of StarCraft AI. It
explains how agents today divides the complex problem of playing StarCraft into
subproblems that are solvable in real-time, as well as gives an overview over
the overall architecture of some of the most successful bots as of Spring
2012. We also explain the BWAPI architecture, and how it utilizes shared memory
and JNI to allow bots written in Java. Section \ref{sec:cogarch} describes the
models of cognition and the theory
behind them and a description of how this architecture can be used.
Section \ref{sec:lida} describes the LIDA model of cognition.
